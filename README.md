## FEATURES

- UI Automation: Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable UI tests with Playwright.
- API Automation: OAuth2 client credentials flow with token management and storage.
- Cross-Browser Support: Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Environment Management: Multi-environment support (DEV, SIT, UAT) with dotenv.
- Logging & Reporting: Centralized logging utility and HTML/test reports.
- Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for consistent code standards.
- Containerization: Docker support for isolated test execution.
- Parallel Execution: Optimized for CI with retries and parallel workers.
- Enterprise Practices: Input validation, error handling, retries, and comprehensive documentation.

## PREREQUISITES

- Node.js: Version 18.x or higher (LTS recommended).
- npm: Version 8.x or higher.
- Git: For cloning the repository.
- Docker (optional): For containerized execution.
- Environment Variables: Access to API credentials (e.g., CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET).

## INSTALLATION

1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/PlayWright-UI-Automation.git
   cd PlayWright-UI-Automation

2. Install Dependencies:
   npm install

3. Install Playwright Browsers:
   npx playwright install

4. Set Up Environment:
   - Copy and configure environment files in src/environments/ (e.g., DEV.env).
   - Ensure required variables like API_BASE_URL, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET are set.

5. Verify Setup:
   npm run lint
   npm test -- --dry-run

## CONFIGURATION

Environment Files

- Located in src/environments/.
- Supported environments: DEV.env, SIT.env, UAT.env.
- Set NODE_ENV to switch (e.g., NODE_ENV=SIT npm test).

Playwright Config

- Main config: playwright.config.ts.
- Key settings:
  - Test directory: src/tests/
  - Timeouts: 50s for tests, 10s for assertions.
  - Retries: 2 on CI.
  - Reporters: List and HTML.
  - Projects: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.

API Authentication

- OAuth2 setup in src/api-lib/authmgr/oauth.setup.ts.
- Tokens stored in .auth/user.json for reuse.

## USAGE

Running Tests

- All Tests:
  npm test

- Specific Test File:
  npx playwright test src/tests/ui/user.validations.spec.ts

- With Environment:
  NODE_ENV=SIT npm test

- Headed Mode (for debugging):
  npx playwright test --headed

- Generate Report:
  npx playwright show-report

API Tests

- Located in src/tests/api/.
- Example: src/tests/api/paypal.spec.ts.

UI Tests

- Located in src/tests/ui/.
- Example: src/tests/ui/user.validations.spec.ts.
- Uses fixtures in src/fixtures/app.fixtures.ts for setup/teardown.

Docker Execution
docker build -t playwright-automation .
docker run --rm playwright-automation

TESTING
-------
- Unit Tests: Add tests for utilities (e.g., Logger) using Jest or similar.
- Integration Tests: Ensure API and UI components interact correctly.
- Flakiness Handling: Use retries, waits, and assertions for stability.
- Data Management: Use dynamic data generation to avoid conflicts.

CI/CD
-----
- GitHub Actions: Workflow in .github/workflows/playwright.yml runs tests on push/PR.
- Pre-commit Hooks: Husky ensures linting and formatting via .lintstagedrc.
- Parallelism: Configured for efficient CI execution.
- Artifacts: Upload reports and traces on failure.

CONTRIBUTING
------------
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature.
3. Follow code standards: Run npm run lint:fix before committing.
4. Add tests for new features.
5. Submit a PR with a clear description.

Code Standards
- Linting: ESLint with TypeScript and Prettier.
- Commits: Conventional commits (enforced by Husky).
- Reviews: All PRs require review.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- Test Failures: Check playwright-report/index.html for traces and screenshots.
- Environment Issues: Verify .env files and NODE_ENV.
- Browser Issues: Reinstall browsers with npx playwright install --force.
- API Errors: Check .auth/user.json and token validity.
- Performance: Reduce workers or increase timeouts if needed.
